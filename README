These are the main files for this assignment
index.html						HTML template
index.js						Angularjs gets data from Github Api
index.css						CSS styling for the index

Assumptions:
1. Assume we want mobile friendly
2. Cross browser 

Objective:
1. Create a service that search for a GitHub username from GitHub Api.
2. Display users Github Handle, follower count and list of follower.
3. Create a load more button to get more follower (GitHub only retrieves 30 followers at a time)

How to Use:
	Type in the username to search for. The search has a debounce of 1.5 sec to wait after typing.
	If there are more than 30 followers, the 'Load More' button will display.
	The followers image are clickable links that opens a new GitHub page of the user.

Compile:
	Open index.html with a browser. (Require internet for bootstrap and angularjs cdn)

Description:
	Notes:
		This is just a simple standard page with angularjs and some mobile friendly.

	Additional Time:
		Unit and Integration test
		Allow more in depth search by taking more parameter for the GitHub Api
		Implement tracking to see what users searched
		Allow searching for multiple users

	Problem:
		User wants to search for username and data from GitHub

	Solution:
		Create a web page to take in a username and send a http request to Github for data.

	Technical Choices:
		This page structure is pretty basic. Angularjs helps keep the structure clean and easy to understand.
		Bootstrap helps with the mobile friendliness, so the grid system was better than using table for display.
		If we want to do more, we could create javascript classes to store the user's data.
